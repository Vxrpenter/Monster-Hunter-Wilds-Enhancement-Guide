> [!WARNING]
> This is just a guide. I don't wrote any of the mods, reshades etc. This is just a set of instructions to help players find a way to play this game. This guide is has also some addons for Linux users because there are some extra steps for them to mod the game. Every instructionset with the almighty penguin xD can be safely skipped if you don't use Linux

## General Settings

First of all you should change some settings for both your performance sake and more.

### Upscaling and Frame Generation
- **FRAME GENRATION** : As you should have noticed the game wants you to turn on frame generation real bad when you start it up. This can improve your FPS but **ONLY** when you are already running on stable 60 FPS. So the Frame Generation is really usefull for all of you running a e.g. 1440p or higher monitor
- **AI Upscaling** : Next we have DLSS and FSR. In the game there is no DLSS 4.0 available but you an force it's use thorugh the [Nvidea App](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/) (resulting in tests by [BenchmarKing](https://www.youtube.com/@benchmarking4386) in higher performance cost). Also if you are using an Nvidea GPU that can run DLSS 4 you might want to install the mod [NVIDIA Streamline update for DLSS 4 FG 310.2.1](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/193?tab=description) by [Reiji21](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Reiji21). For install check the authors really good instructions.

### Brightness Settings
You should adjust your brightness settings to really improve the games visuals. Although it's not the best option it still works well. Try changing the third brightness to a lower value for best results.

### Other Settings
No other settings will be discussed here because they don't really improve the performance even when lowered. Also dropping a game to the lowest settings to just get it to work should never be an option (although it sadly is in many modern releases).
